                    Bone cancer is when unusual cells grow out of control in your bone. It destroys normal bone tissue. It may start in your bone or spread there from other parts of your body (called metastasis). Bone cancer is rare. Most bone tumors are benign, which means they aren't cancer and don't spread to other areas of your body. {`\n\n`}The different types of bone cancer include: Multiple myeloma (MM)
Multiple myeloma is the most common type of bone cancer. It occurs when cancer cells grow in the bone marrow and cause tumors in various bones. MM usually affects older adults.Among bone cancers, MM has one of the best prognoses, and many people who have it don’t require treatment.
{`\n\n`}Osteosarcoma (Osteogenic sarcoma)
Osteosarcoma, or osteogenic sarcoma, generally affects children and adolescents, but it can also occur in adults. It has a tendency to originate at the tips of the long bones in the arms and legs.

Osteosarcoma may also start in the hips, shoulders, or other locations. It affects the hard tissue that provides the outer layer of your bones.{`\n\n`}Chondrosarcoma
Chondrosarcoma may occur in the pelvis, thigh areas, and shoulders of older adults.

It forms in the subchondral tissue, which is the tough connective tissue between your bones. This is the second most common primary cancer involving the bones.{`\n\n`}Ewing’s sarcoma
Ewing’s sarcoma is a rare cancer that either begins in the soft tissues surrounding the bones or directly in the bones of children and young adults.

The long bones of the body — such as the arms and legs — and the pelvis are commonly affected.
